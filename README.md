# Twitter Gridder

A CSS-Grid Exercise

## Introduction

Remember when we copied an Instragram profile using Flexbox? Those were good times. Let's bring them back by doing the same thing, only with a Twitter profile and CSS Grid. I give you: Twitter Gridder.

## The Basics

Using CSS Grid (no Flexbox!), you'll make a page that emulates the following mobile page:

## Guidelines

You do NOT have to use more than 4 columns. The grid may not perfectly line up, and that is totally okay. 

We've screen-shotted just a ton of images for this one. Make sure before you try to replicate any content that you check whether there's already an image of it! The focus is NOT on content, but on layout.

Again, getting exact margins is NOT our focus on this, only general layout using CSS Grid.

You may end up with grids within grids. You could also do this one large grid.

Good luck!
